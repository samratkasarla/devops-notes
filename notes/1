self managed , self healing kubernetes architecture.
we as a operator have to take less manual effort because of that.

3 process must be installed on every node

1. container runtime
2. kubelet -interact with both container and nodes. kubelet start the pods with the container.

3. kube-proxy
which lowers the network overhead

how to 1. schedule a pods
       2. moniter the pods
       3. reschedule or restart the pods
       4. join  a new node
