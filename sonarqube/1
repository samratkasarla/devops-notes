SonarQube, is a self-managed, automatic code review tool that systematically helps you deliver Clean Code.
The tool analyses 30+ different programming languages and integrates into your CI pipeline and DevOps platform to ensure that your code meets high-quality standards.
The Clean as You Code approach uses your Quality Gate to alert/inform you when thereâ€™s something to fix or review in your New Code (code that has been added or changed), allowing you to maintain high standards and focus on code quality.

A Quality Gate is an indicator of code quality that can be configured to give a go/no-go signal on the current release-worthiness of the code. It indicates whether your code is clean and can move forward
A passing (green) Quality Gate means the code meets your standard and is ready to be merged.
A failing (red) Quality Gate means there are issues to address.
