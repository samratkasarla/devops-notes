A backend defines where Terraform stores its state data files.

Terraform uses persisted state data to keep track of the resources it manages. Most non-trivial Terraform configurations either integrate with Terraform Cloud or use a backend to store state remotely. This lets multiple people access the state data and work together on that collection of infrastructure resources.

This page describes how to configure a backend by adding the backend block to your configuration.
