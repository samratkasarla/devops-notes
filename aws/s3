Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.

Features of Amazon S3
1. Storage classes
Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. For example, you can store mission-critical production data in S3 Standard for frequent access, save costs by storing infrequently accessed data in S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA, and archive data at the lowest costs in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
You can store data with changing or unknown access patterns in S3 Intelligent-Tiering, which optimizes storage costs by automatically moving your data between four access tiers when your access patterns change.

2. Storage management
Amazon S3 has storage management features that you can use to manage costs, meet regulatory requirements, reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of your data for compliance requirements.

#########S3 Lifecycle – Configure a lifecycle policy to manage your objects and store them cost effectively throughout their lifecycle. You can transition objects to other S3 storage classes or expire objects that reach the end of their lifetimes.

##########S3 Object Lock – Prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletions.

###########S3 Replication – Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more destination buckets in the same or different AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, security, and other use cases.

###########S3 Batch Operations – Manage billions of objects at scale with a single S3 API request or a few clicks in the Amazon S3 console. You can use Batch Operations to perform operations such as Copy, Invoke AWS Lambda function, and Restore on millions or billions of objects.

3. Access management
Amazon S3 provides features for auditing and managing access to your buckets and objects. By default, S3 buckets and the objects in them are private. You have access only to the S3 resources that you create. To grant granular resource permissions that support your specific use case or to audit the permissions of your Amazon S3 resources, you can use the following features.

####S3 Block Public Access – Block public access to S3 buckets and objects. By default, Block Public Access settings are turned on at the account and bucket level.

####AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Create IAM users for your AWS account to manage access to your Amazon S3 resources. For example, you can use IAM with Amazon S3 to control the type of access a user or group of users has to an S3 bucket that your AWS account owns.

####Bucket policies – Use IAM-based policy language to configure resource-based permissions for your S3 buckets and the objects in them.

####Amazon S3 access points – Configure named network endpoints with dedicated access policies to manage data access at scale for shared datasets in Amazon S3.

####Access control lists (ACLs) – Grant read and write permissions for individual buckets and objects to authorized users. As a general rule, we recommend using S3 resource-based policies (bucket policies and access point policies) or IAM policies for access control instead of ACLs. ACLs are an access control mechanism that predates resource-based policies and IAM. For more information about when you'd use ACLs instead of resource-based policies or IAM policies, see Access policy guidelines.

S3 Object Ownership – Disable ACLs and take ownership of every object in your bucket, simplifying access management for data stored in Amazon S3. You, as the bucket owner, automatically own and have full control over every object in your bucket, and access control for your data is based on policies.

Access Analyzer for S3 – Evaluate and monitor your S3 bucket access policies, ensuring that the policies provide only the intended access to your S3 resources.
