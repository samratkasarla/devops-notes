Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

Amazon EKS:

#Runs and scales the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
#Automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version updates and patching for them.
#Is integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications, including the following capabilities:
1.Amazon ECR for container images
2.Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution
3.IAM for authentication
4.Amazon VPC for isolation
