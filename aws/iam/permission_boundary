Permissions boundaries for IAM entities

AWS supports permissions boundaries for IAM entities (users or roles). A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries.

For more information about policy types, see Policy types.

You can use an AWS managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for an IAM entity (user or role). That policy limits the maximum permissions for the user or role.

For example, assume that the IAM user named ShirleyRodriguez should be allowed to manage only Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon EC2. To enforce this rule, you can use the following policy to set the permissions boundary for the ShirleyRodriguez user:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

When you use a policy to set the permissions boundary for a user, it limits the user's permissions but does not provide permissions on its own. In this example, the policy sets the maximum permissions of ShirleyRodriguez as all operations in Amazon S3, CloudWatch, and Amazon EC2. Shirley can never perform operations in any other service, including IAM, even if she has a permissions policy that allows it.
